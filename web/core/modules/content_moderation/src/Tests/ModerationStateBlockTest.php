  /**
   * Tests moderating custom blocks.
   *
   * Blocks and any non-node-type-entities do not have a concept of
   * "published". As such, we must use the "default revision" to know what is
   * going to be "published", i.e. visible to the user.
   *
   * The one exception is a block that has never been "published". When a block
   * is first created, it becomes the "default revision". For each edit of the
   * block after that, Content Moderation checks the "default revision" to
   * see if it is set to a published moderation state. If it is not, the entity
   * being saved will become the "default revision".
   *
   * The test below is intended, in part, to make this behavior clear.
   *
   * @see \Drupal\content_moderation\EntityOperations::entityPresave
