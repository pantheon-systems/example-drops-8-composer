------------------------
- Fixed security issues. See SA-CORE-2017-002.

Drupal 8.3.0, 2017-04-05
------------------------
- Added modules:
    * Added the Workflows module (experimental) which abstracts transitions and
      states from Content Moderation into a separate component for reuse by
      other modules implementing non-publishing workflows.
    * Added the Layout Discovery module (experimental) which provides an API for
      modules or themes to register layouts.
    * Added the Field Layout module (experimental) which provides the ability
      for site builders to rearrange fields on content types, block types, etc.
      into new regions, for both the form and display, on the same forms
      provided by the normal field user interface.
- Updated vendor libraries:
    * Updated to Twig 1.25.
    * Updated to jQuery 2.2.4.
    * Updated to CKEditor 4.6.2 (with new Moono-Lisa skin).
    * Updated Symfony components to 2.8.18.
    * Updated PHPUnit to 4.8.35.
    * Applied patch-level updates to the latest versions for all dependencies
      wherever possible. Minor updates applied for Symfony PSR-7 Bridge and
      Zend Stdlib, which Drupal does not depend on directly.
- Browser support:
    * Advance notice: Internet Explore 9 and 10 will no longer supported from
      8.4.x, scheduled for October 2017. Microsoft has now ended support for
      these browsers. Drupal will still support Internet Explorer 11 and its
      replacement, Edge.
- Raised stability levels of experimental modules:
    * Updated the BigPipe module from beta to stable.
    * Updated the Migrate module from alpha to beta.
    * See https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#versions for more
      information about the stability levels of experimental modules.
- Improved authoring features:
    * Can now drag and drop images into image fields in Quick Edit mode.
    * Image fields are now limited to only accepting images, so that users on
      mobile clients are not offered a confusing and non-functional video
      upload option.
    * CKEditor now utilizes the AutoGrow plugin to better take advantage of
      larger screen sizes.
- Improved site building and administration:
    * Redesigned status report.
    * Standardized display of Views overview page to more closely match that of
      other administrative overview pages.
    * Views filter order now matches the table column order below in Content
      and People overview pages.
    * The "Allowed HTML tags" input has been converted to a textarea, which
      significantly improves the usability of HTML filter configuration.
    * Removed the 'disabled' region from block administration.
    * Incoming paths are again case-insensitive for routing, similar to earlier
      major Drupal versions.
- Content Moderation improvements (experimental):
    * Refactored to use new experimental Workflows module.
    * Now supports moderation of non-translatable entity types.
    * When reverting a moderated revision, the moderation state is now
      reverted too.
    * Added an API to create and enforce default workflow states and
      transitions.
    * Allow moderation of entity types without bundles, as long as they have
      revisions.
    * Publishes any entity type that implements EntityPublishedInterface, not
      just Nodes.
- Migration improvements (experimental):
    * Drupal 7 core node translations are now migrated to Drupal 8.
    * Configuration translation support is added to migrations in general and
      implemented for Drupal 6 user profile fields.
- Improved REST API and decoupled site features:
    * REST API now supports the registering of users.
    * Anonymous REST API performance increased by 60% by utilizing the internal
      page cache.
    * Improved the response bodies and status codes for requests with incorrect
      request headers or request bodies, in dozens of situations.
    * Massive overhaul of the test coverage.
    * 403 responses now return reason why access was denied.
    * Serialized values for Booleans and integers are now returned as the
      correct data type, rather than incorrectly typed as strings.
- Improved performance/scalability:
    * Optimized class loader detection made more generic to support class
      loaders other than ApcClassLoader.
    * ViewsData and Token info cache now use the default cache bin to prevent
      APCu memory from being filled too quickly.
    * Improve statistics performance by adding a swappable backend.
- Improved developer APIs:
    * Deprecated several routing services in favor of two more unified services.
    * Replaced the deprecated Symfony ExecutionContextInterface by subclassing
      from ConstraintValidator to prepare for an update to Symfony 3.
    * EntityPublishedInterface and EntityPublishedTrait have been added to give
      a generic publishing API, and are being used by Node and Comment entity
      types.
    * Added a collection label to EntityType. This is a plural uppercase label
      for a collection of entities - e.g. "Workflows".
- Changed coding standards:
    * Officially adopted short array syntax and updated all of core accordingly.
    * PHP CodeSniffer and Drupal Coder have been added as composer dev
      requirements, so they can be installed automatically with
      `composer install --dev` rather than requiring separate installation. (Do
      not use `composer install --dev` for production sites.)
    * Most global constants in Drupal 8 have been deprecated in favor of class
      constants. As a best practice, use appropriate class constants rather than
      global constants.
- Testing improvements:
    * Integrated PHPUnit verbose output in SimpleTest UI.
    * Improved backward compatibility with WebTestBase.
    * Improved backward compatibility between BrowserTestBase and WebTestBase.
    * Many old WebTestBase tests have been moved to BrowserTestBase.

      configuration structure is also still supported.)
    * Improved the response messages and status codes for requests with missing
      or incorrect headers.
    * Improved responses to PATCH requests to entity resources to contain the
      updated entity in the response body.

      visitors.
    * Added an administrator role which is assigned all permissions for
      installed modules automatically.
    * Image toolkits are now provided by modules (rather than requiring a
      manual file copy to the includes directory).
    * Added an edit tab to taxonomy term pages.
    * Redesigned password strength validator.
    * Redesigned the add content type screen.
    * Highlight duplicate URL aliases.
    * Renamed "input formats" to "text formats".
    * Moved text format permissions to the main permissions page.
    * Added configurable ability for users to cancel their own accounts.
    * Added "vertical tabs", a reusable interface component that features
      automatic summaries and increases usability.
    * Replaced fieldsets on node edit and add pages with vertical tabs.
- Performance:
    * Improved performance on uncached page views by loading multiple core
      objects in a single database query.
    * Improved performance for logged-in users by reducing queries for path
      alias lookups.
    * Improved support for HTTP proxies (including reverse proxies), allowing
      anonymous page views to be served entirely from the proxy.
- Documentation:
    * Hook API documentation now included in Drupal core.
- News aggregator:
    * Added OPML import functionality for RSS feeds.
    * Optionally, RSS feeds may be configured to not automatically generate feed blocks.
- Search:
    * Added support for language-aware searches.
- Aggregator:
    * Introduced architecture that allows pluggable parsers and processors for
      syndicating RSS and Atom feeds.
    * Added options to suspend updating specific feeds and never discard feeds
      items.
- Testing:
    * Added test framework and tests.
- Improved time zone support:
    * Drupal now uses PHP's time zone database when rendering dates in local
      time. Site-wide and user-configured time zone offsets have been converted
      to time zone names; for example, Africa/Abidjan.
    * In some cases the upgrade and install scripts do not choose the preferred
      site default time zone. The automatically-selected time zone can be
      corrected at admin/config/regional/settings.
    * If your site is being upgraded from Drupal 6 and you do not have the
      contributed date or event modules installed, user time zone settings will
      fallback to the system time zone and will have to be reconfigured by each user.
    * User-configured time zones now serve as the default time zone for PHP
      date/time functions.
- Filter system:
    * Revamped the filter API and text format storage.
    * Added support for default text formats to be assigned on a per-role basis.
    * Refactored the HTML corrector to take advantage of PHP 5 features.
- User system:
    * Added clean API functions for creating, loading, updating, and deleting
      user roles and permissions.
    * Refactored the "access rules" component of user module: The user module
      now provides a simple interface for blocking single IP addresses. The
      previous functionality in the user module for restricting certain email
      addresses and usernames is now available as a contributed module. Further,
      IP address range blocking is no longer supported and should be implemented
      at the operating system level.
    * Removed per-user themes: Contributed modules with similar functionality
      are available.
- OpenID:
    * Added support for Gmail and Google Apps for Domain identifiers. Users can
      now log in with their user@example.com identifier when example.com is
      powered by Google.
    * Made the OpenID module more pluggable.
- Added code registry:
    * Using the registry, modules declare their includable files via their .info file,
      allowing Drupal to lazy-load classes and interfaces as needed.
- Theme system:
    * Removed the Bluemarine, Chameleon and Pushbutton themes. These themes live
      on as contributed themes (https://www.drupal.org/project/bluemarine,
      https://www.drupal.org/project/chameleon and
      https://www.drupal.org/project/pushbutton).
    * Added Stark theme to make analyzing Drupal's default HTML and CSS easier.
    * Added Seven as the default administration theme.
    * Variable preprocessing of theme hooks prior to template rendering now goes
      through two phases: a 'preprocess' phase and a new 'process' phase. See
      http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme/7 for details.
    * Theme hooks implemented as functions (rather than as templates) can now
      also have preprocess (and process) functions. See
      http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme/7 for details.
    * Added Bartik as the default theme.
- File handling:
    * Files are now first class Drupal objects with file_load(), file_save(),
      and file_validate() functions and corresponding hooks.
    * The file_move(), file_copy() and file_delete() functions now operate on
      file objects and invoke file hooks so that modules are notified and can
      respond to changes.
    * For the occasions when only basic file manipulation are needed--such as
      uploading a site logo--that don't require the overhead of databases and
      hooks, the current unmanaged copy, move and delete operations have been
      preserved but renamed to file_unmanaged_*().
    * Rewrote file handling to use PHP stream wrappers to enable support for
      both public and private files and to support pluggable storage mechanisms
      and access to remote resources (for example, S3 storage or Flickr photos).
    * The mime_extension_mapping variable has been removed. Modules that need to
      alter the default MIME type extension mappings should implement
      hook_file_mimetype_mapping_alter().
    * Added the hook_file_url_alter() hook, which makes it possible to serve
      files from a CDN.
    * Added a field specifically for uploading files, previously provided by
      the contributed module FileField.
- Image handling:
    * Improved image handling, including better support for add-on image
      libraries.
    * Added API and interface for creating advanced image thumbnails.
    * Inclusion of additional effects such as rotate and desaturate.
    * Added a field specifically for uploading images, previously provided by
      the contributed module ImageField.
- Added aliased multi-site support:
    * Added support for mapping domain names to sites directories.
- Added RDF support:
    * Modules can declare RDF namespaces which are serialized in the <html> tag
      for RDFa support.
    * Modules can specify how their data structure maps to RDF.
    * Added support for RDFa export of nodes, comments, terms, users, etc. and
      their fields.
- Search engine optimization and web linking:
    * Added a rel="canonical" link on node and comment pages to prevent
      duplicate content indexing by search engines.
    * Added a default rel="shortlink" link on node and comment pages that
      advertises a short link as an alternative URL to third-party services.
    * Meta information is now alterable by all modules before rendering.
- Field API:
    * Custom data fields may be attached to nodes, users, comments and taxonomy
      terms.
    * Node bodies and teasers are now Field API fields instead of
      being a hard-coded property of node objects.
    * In addition, any other object type may register with Field API
      and allow custom data fields to be attached to itself.
    * Provides most of the features of the former Content Construction
      Kit (CCK) module.
    * Taxonomy terms are now Field API fields that can be added to any fieldable
      object.
- Installer:
    * Refactored the installer into an API that allows Drupal to be installed
      via a command line script.
- Page organization
    * Made the help text area a full featured region with blocks.
    * Site mission is replaced with the highlighted content block region and
      separate RSS feed description settings.
    * The footer message setting was removed in favor of custom blocks.
    * Made the main page content a block which can be moved and ordered
      with other blocks in the same region.
    * Blocks can now return structured arrays for later rendering just
      like page callbacks.
- Translation system
    * The translation system now supports message context (msgctxt).
    * Added support for translatable fields to Field API.
- JavaScript changes
    * Upgraded the core JavaScript library to jQuery version 1.4.4.
    * Upgraded the jQuery Forms library to 2.52.
    * Added jQuery UI 1.8.7, which allows improvements to Drupal's user
      experience.
- Better module version support
    * Modules now can specify which version of another module they depend on.
- Removed modules from core
    * The following modules have been removed from core, because contributed
      modules with similar functionality are available:
      * Blog API module
      * Ping module
      * Throttle module
- Improved node access control system.
    * All modules may now influence the access to a node at runtime, not just
      the module that defined a node.
    * Users may now be allowed to bypass node access restrictions without giving
      them complete access to the site.
    * Access control affects both published and unpublished nodes.
    * Numerous other improvements to the node access system.
- Actions system
    * Simplified definitions of actions and triggers.
    * Removed dependency on the combination of hooks and operations. Triggers
      now directly map to module hooks.

    * Added queue API support to cron API.
    * Added a locking framework to coordinate long-running operations across
      requests.

- New watchdog as a hook functionality.
   * New hook_watchdog that can be implemented by any module to route log
     messages to various destinations.
   * Expands the severity levels from 3 (Error, Warning, Notice) to the 8
     levels defined in RFC 3164.

    * Story sections make the open submission more adaptive in that you can set individual post, dump and expiration thresholds for each section according to the story type and urgency level: stories in certain sections do not "expire" and might stay interesting and active as time passes by, whereas news-related stories are only considered "hot" over a short period of time.
- Multiple vhosts + multiple directories:
    * You can set up multiple Drupal sites on top of the same physical source tree either by using vhosts or sub-directories.

- Added "search infrastructure":
    * Improved search page and integrated search functionality in the administration pages.
- Added translation / localization / internationalization support:

- Added fine-grained user permission (or group) system:
    * Users can be granted access to specific administration sections. Example: a FAQ maintainer can be given access to maintain the FAQ and translators can be given access to the translation pages.
