    # Tests on this pull request are currently failing. I suspect that is because
    # with a composer lock file, all the dependencies can be downloaded
    # immediately. That means drupal core can be downloaded before the merge
    # plugin has processed the shared settings that say the installer path
    # for core is web/core
    # THIS CHANGE SHOULD NOT BE MERGED. IT IS FOR DEBUGGING THE PULL REQUEST.

    # Using > instead of >> will overwrite the file and disable xdebug.
    # xdebug makes composer slower.
