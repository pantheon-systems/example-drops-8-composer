 * used the Execute PHP feature of devel.module, this is the drush equivalent.
 *
 * You may edit this file with whatever php you choose. Then execute the file
 * using `drush script scratch.php`. That command will bootstrap your drupal
 * site and then run the php below.
 *
 * The script command enables you to store your script files wherever you wish and
 * will help you list all of them should you collection grow. See its help.
