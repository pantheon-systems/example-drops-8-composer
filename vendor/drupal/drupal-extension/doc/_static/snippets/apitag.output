Feature: Drush alias
  In order to demonstrate the Drush driver
  As a trainer
  I need to show how to tag scenarios

  Scenario: Untagged scenario uses blackbox driver and fails
    # features/drush.feature:6
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "authenticated user" role 
    # FeatureContext::iAmLoggedInWithRole()
      No ability to create users in Drupal\Driver\BlackboxDriver. 
      Put `@api` into your feature and add an api driver 
      (ex: `api_driver: drupal`) in behat.yml.
    When I click "My account"                                         
    # FeatureContext::iClick()
    Then I should see the heading "History"                           
    # FeatureContext::assertHeading()

  @api
  Scenario: Tagged scenario uses Drush driver and succeeds            
            # features/drush.feature:12
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "authenticated user" role 
    # FeatureContext::iAmLoggedInWithRole()
    When I click "My account"                                         
    # FeatureContext::iClick()
    Then I should see the heading "History"                           
    # FeatureContext::assertHeading()

2 scenarios (1 passed, 1 failed)
6 steps (3 passed, 2 skipped, 1 failed)
