 * Database Cursor Interface.
 * A cursor is used by Query Writers to fetch Query Result rows

 * be quite large. This interface dscribes the API of a database
 * cursor. There can be multiple implementations of the Cursor,
 * by default RedBeanPHP offers the PDOCursor for drivers shipping
 * with RedBeanPHP and the NULLCursor.
