# Diffy Integration

You need to set up two environmental variables `DIFFY_API_KEY` and `DIFFY_PROJECT_ID` in CircleCI for integration to work.

There is a terminus command [https://github.com/DiffyWebsite/diffy-build-tools-plugin](https://github.com/DiffyWebsite/diffy-build-tools-plugin) available to help you out.

Read more about this set up at [https://diffy.website/documentation/pantheon-build-tools](https://diffy.website/documentation/pantheon-build-tools).
